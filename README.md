# budget.ny.gov-components
Repo for static components for budget.ny.gov

This is built using the NYSDS 11ty Distribution at [https://github.com/OGS-Digital-Service/digital-services-utilities] 

## Stuff we need here
- 11ty installed and ready to build template files
- prod ready NYSDS CSS & JS + purged tailwind css
- 11ty templates, components, and custom layout configured in the right directories

## Stuff we don't need here
- tailwindcss because all development should happen at the utilities system level, not at the project site level.
